 LLM-Based Human Language Detection

This project is an AI-powered system designed to detect and classify human languages using a Large Language Model (LLM). The model processes textual input and accurately identifies the language being used, supporting a wide range of natural human languages.

 Project Overview

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, capable of generating text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. Developed a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM.
The dataset comprises of many essays from different LLMs. 

 Features
-  Built using transformer-based architectures "distilbert-base-uncased"
-  Reports model accuracy and supports evaluation metrics
-  Easy integration with NLP pipelines and other ML services

 How It Works

1. Input a text snippet in any human language.
2. The model encodes the input using LLM embeddings.
3. A classification head predicts the language label from the encoded representation.
